    <h1>Programming: The Art of Problem Solving</h1>
    <p>Programming, also known as coding, is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform specific tasks. It is a skill that enables us to build software, applications, websites, games, and much more. From controlling robots to managing vast databases, programming powers the digital world around us.</p>
    <h2>Why Learn Programming?</h2>
    <p>Learning programming is not just about becoming a software developer; it’s about enhancing problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity. Programmers design solutions to real-world problems using code, and this ability to create, automate, and innovate opens doors in almost every industry.</p>
    <h2>Popular Programming Languages</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
        <p>Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is great for beginners and widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.</p>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
        <p>JavaScript is the backbone of web development. It helps create interactive and dynamic websites and is used both on the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end).</p>
        <li><strong> Java</strong></li>
        <p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented language used in web applications, Android development, and enterprise-level solutions. Its "write once, run anywhere" capability makes it a popular choice.</p>
        <li><strong>C++</strong></li>
        <p>A high-performance language often used in game development, system programming, and applications where speed and efficiency are critical.</p>
        <li><strong>Ruby</strong></li>
        <p>Known for its elegant syntax, Ruby is widely used for web development, especially with the Ruby on Rails framework. It emphasizes productivity and simplicity.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Programming Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Problem Definition</strong></li>
        <p> Before writing code, a programmer must understand the problem and define what the solution should achieve. This involves gathering requirements and planning.</p>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Design</strong></li>
        <p>Once the problem is understood, the next step is to design an algorithm—a step-by-step procedure for solving the problem. Algorithms are the heart of programming.</p>
        <li><strong>Writing Code</strong></li>
        <p>After the algorithm is ready, programmers use a programming language to write the actual code. The language chosen depends on the type of application being developed.</p>
        <li><strong>Testing and Debugging</strong></li>
        <p>After writing the code, it needs to be tested to ensure it works correctly. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in the code.</p>
        <li><strong>Maintenance</strong></li>
        <p>Once a program is developed, it may need ongoing maintenance, which involves updating the code to fix bugs, add new features, or improve performance.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Applications of Programming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong>Programmers create websites, web applications, and online services using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Mobile App Development:</strong>Languages like Swift, Kotlin, and Java are used to develop mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong>C++, C#, and specialized game engines like Unity and Unreal are used to create video games.</li><br>
        <li><strong> Data Science and Machine Learning:</strong>Python, R, and MATLAB are popular languages for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong>Programmers use tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing human error.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h2>Famous Programmers and Their Contributions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grace Hopper</strong></li>
        <p>A pioneer in computer programming, Grace Hopper developed one of the first compilers and contributed to the creation of COBOL, a widely-used programming language.</p>
        <li><strong>Linus Torvalds</strong></li>
        <p>Creator of the Linux operating system, Torvalds revolutionized the world of open-source software and operating systems.</p>
        <li><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong></li>
        <p>Inventor of the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee developed the foundational technologies like HTML and HTTP that power the modern internet.</p>
        <li><strong>Margaret Hamilton</strong></li>
        <p>A software engineer who led the development of the onboard flight software for NASA's Apollo missions, helping land humans on the moon.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Get Started with Programming</h2>
